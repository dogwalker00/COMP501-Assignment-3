<p>
With the increasing usage and new developments of robots in the medical field there will be <br>
upincoming opportunities and problems related to this new tech in this industry. Opportunities <br>
that may lead into improvements in operations that requirement precision like in bariatric surgery<br>
and reduce human errors. Robots have risks like data leaks, and Robot-related errors, causing it <br>
to become unreliable. And choices for a successful implenentation of this new technology in the <br>
medical industry.
