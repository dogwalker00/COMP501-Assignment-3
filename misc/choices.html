<p>Choices for Robotics in Medicine and Healthcare (challenges for society)<br><br>

Robotics in Medicine and Healthcare has many benefits, such as increasing the efficiency and processing time of surgeries through surgical assistance robots, these robots allow surgeons to perform complicated operations that use AI and depth cameras. This enables the surgeon to make less invasive procedures like larger incisions in an open surgeries making the recovery time far more longer1. But there are many social challenges that may prevent the adaptions of Robotics being used in medicine and healthcare. Such as check-ups and hospital fees being costly so some may avoid going to clinics, this might cause an under-lying illness being undiagnosed/untreated. But with the rise of automations through robots there will be a less of a need of workers doing low-effort repetitive tasks, and reduce human errors. Tasks like planning appointments, inventory management (keeping record of gloves, needles, soap), and documentation of logs of patients (e.g. booster shots). This will greatly help cut the cost of healthcare. But to be unbiased the usage of robots in healthcare may also increase the cost of some parts of healthcare, such as in surgery. Robots/devices that assist in surgery cost a lot of money to develop and bring into market, due to testing to prevent potential errors from occurring in real-life environments and regulations from government or other agencies to minimize the risk. Based on 2014 study it cost around $31million to take a medical device to the market2. This cost will go to the hospital and then to the customer through fees. But this could be solved through scalability much like in other industries, such as microwaves or TVs being expensive and bulky, but later became far more mass-produced due to the demand increased, and became cheaper due to production cost becoming lower.<p>
Robotics in Medicine and healthcare will introduce challenges for society, we need to figure out 
for a successfully implementation of this new technology in this field. Robotics in healthcare will impact the future employment prospects of the workers in healthcare, for the better or the worst, better because it lowers the amount of stress being put on workers in healthcare through automation. Robots could work under inhuman conditions, working around the clock, and unsafe conditions. But there are negatives, mid-level jobs that require no bachelor’s degree are disappearing, positions such as medical-records clerks are being phased out or pushed out of hospitals into low-paying jobs that relate back to healthcare. Positions in healthcare that were accessible without a college degree are becoming increasingly uncommon due to robots taking over. Organizations and corporations related to healthcare industry are looking to cut expenses to increase their profits, in the Businessweek article the 19 TUGs perform $1 million of human labour/year, but only cost $350,000. A 65% reduction in labour costs. The healthcare sector is quickly taking away jobs from professionals and passing it on to robots1. But personally i think that these robots will replace jobs that are repetitive, jobs that have no contact with the patient like jobs as accounting or billing and management, and not replace jobs such as nursing or doctors, jobs that require empathy and emotion, to give a human touch to increase the effectiveness of the treatment, and reduce the stress of the patient. This is especially needed when a patient is receiving heavy news, where compassion is important in making sure the patient feel well. Also robots could help reduce the stress of health worker by reducing the amount of complex/repetitive work, and improve the environment of the workers, so the healthcare workers improve the care with patients2. 

The demand of services relating to healthcare is increasing (ageing population), and the workforce isn’t keeping up, to met these expectation robots are able to reduce the need of workers that do repetitive work, robots could add more employment opportunities in the healthcare sector, like data analysis, and more of a need for consultants in the medical field. People who have lose their jobs due to robots could be retrained and learn new skills that relate back to healthcare. This will be difficult for the individuals but personally i believe the increase of job opportunities outweighs the job loses due to robots. 
<br><br>
In-between 2015 and 2020 the percentage of the global population aged 60 years old and above will increase, from 12% to 22%1. With the significant increase with the ageing population there will be a   greater need/demand for health sector to meet the needs of the older people, with their increasing aliments due to their age. To supplement the shortage of healthcare workers in the industry, robots in nursing related-work are enable to perform tasks similar to human nurses, such as carrying food/objects to the patient when they’re unable to move out of their bed due to illness or injury, and monitor their vitals. Robot nurses could reduce disease transfer between human nurses and patients. 
But the main problem is robots at the moment is unable to express human qualities such as empathy, or compassion. Compassion and empathy is extremely important aspect in a nurses/doctors job, patients being felt they’re being listened to can create trust between them and depend on them, to show that they’re not alone in their battle. Without human connection between the patient and nurse might decrease the effectiveness of the treatment, and increase the recovery time of the patient. 
An example of environment where human connection is needed is with children, children might experience fear or anxiety in a healthcare setting especially with needles, the nurses need to make sure they feel safe and comfortable or else the child might become withdraw or aggressive at the procedure, making the treatment far more difficult. Some people might view robot nurses taking care of old or the disabled as we as a society/healthcare is giving up on them, looks like we’re not willing to listen to them or understand, and just give them an object that is unable to understand the situation to replace the specialness of human connection. What i believe is nothing beats human connection, to combat the need of human connection during treatment and after, i think that human nurses need to work together with robotic nurses during treatment, to give a human feeling during the operation. The human nurses could introduce the robot nurse to kids, give them names, personalities and show they’re able to trust the robot, so they won’t be afraid of it. And human nurses could invite friend or relatives of the patient, or have emotion-support dogs to reduce loneliness, and release stress after or before the operation. But if they’re allergic, unable to fed and clean after the pet then they could receive the robot nurse.
