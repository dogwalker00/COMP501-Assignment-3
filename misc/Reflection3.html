I personally think Robots in Medicine and Healthcare is able to change the health sector for the positive. But along with Ethical drawbacks, robots in healthcare sector might impact workers and future employment in the Medical industry. Employees at the moment are being pushed out of the hospitals and into low-paying jobs.<br>
Some people might be uncomfortable with receiving care from robots, robots are unable to reassure the patient with the procedure. They're unable to make sure the patient feels comfortable with the operation, patients could give consent but do they really mean it, there are nuances in human conversations, and robots are unable to detect this.<br><br>
My recommendations is to retrain the employees who are not useful anymore, so they could adapt into the new environment with robots in the workspace, increasing the workforce of the industry.<br>
another recommendation is to make sure the patients feel comfortable with robots is to bring nurses/health staff and make they introduce/educate on how the robot works. And have nurses/doctors ask for consent on the operation instead of the robot.<br>
My last recommendation is to be transparent with the development and programming of robots. Like open-sourcing the program so anyone could see how they work. So anyone is able to identify any problems within the robot system.
<br><br>
My personal reflection on working on this project is how complex adding robitics in the healthcare industry is. We need to view and understand limitations and capabilities of robots, to make sure there isn't any design oversights and errors from happening
in the real life world. We need to solve these issues before we implement in real life situations and for a successful adaption of robots within this field, or else people will reject this new technology, thus decreasing their quality of life.
