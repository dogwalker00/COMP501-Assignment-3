<h1>Chosen Technology/Topic</h1>


</ul><h5><p>The page or area describing your chosen technology/topic and why it is significant and/or has important implications for society.<p></h5>

<p><em>When deciding on your chosen technology/topic, it is best not to choose something too broad, but limit the focus e.g. consider the level of social analysis from the figure below.</p></em>
<p><em>E.g. What is the level of analysis - culture or organization; Responsibility - individual or pro fessional; Ethical issue - power or equity; Technology - medical, nuclear, mobile?</p></em>

</ul><h6><p>ex. Martin, C. D., Huff, C., Gotterbarn, D., & Miller, K. (1996). A framework for implementing and teaching the social and ethical impact of computing. Education and Information Technologies, 1(2), 101-122.<p></h6>
<p>Our topic is Robotics in Medicine and Healthcare,
the reason why we have chosen this field is because of the<br>
technological advancements in recent years of robots in many different industries, and we have interest in<br>
healthcare as well, to improve patient outcome in the health sector.
The combination of these two fields into <br>one topic allows us to explore both of these interesting topics for our project.
 </p>
 
<p>
Medicine and healthcare are very important for our society, it handles treatment, diagnosis, prevention <br>
of ailments, and the promotion of wellbeing. Overall Healthcare is very important for our society, it improves<br>
quality of life of many individuals with chronic health conditions (e.g. diabetes), and it help supports people<br>
who have physical or mental health needs. It allows people to be producive despite of underlaying aliments, <br>
allowing them to contribute to society and it's wellbeing. With the usage of Robotics within this field it <br>
allows for far better accurate diagnosis of people with hidden health conditions, with Ai-assisted imaging. <br> 
This will reduce the amount of people who need to deal with and be held back by their health condition, Thus <br>
reducing the productivity/contribution within their own society. <br><br>
Healthcare could also increase equity between individuals within the society, some people have health defect<br>
from when they were born. With Healthcare it allows individual such like these a chance to live fulfilling <br>
fulfillinf lives, and address health disparities in society. <br>
Lastly healthcare system reflects on the cultural values of the society, values of care, compassion and <br>
support of one another. The further easer access of healthcare services shows us as a society prioritize <br>
values of taking care of each other and well-being.
