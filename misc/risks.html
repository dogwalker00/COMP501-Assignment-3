<p class="main"> Risks for Robotics in Medicine and Healthcare<br><br>
Despite the numerous opportunities that robotics brings into medicine and healthcare,
there are also several risks and challenges. In July of 2019, the Ministry of Health of New
Zealand released advice for the Emerging Health Technology for robotics in healthcare and
medicine focusing on the New Zealand public health.<br><br>
One of the primary challenges mentioned was the adoption of modern technologies due to
financial constraints. Many pioneering technologies remain out of reach for individuals as
they are not publicly funded, further exacerbating the issue of inequality and division
between the privileged and marginalized communities.<br><br>
The integration of innovative technologies imposes the challenges of retraining healthcare
and medical professionals. The government must invest in comprehensive training programs
to ensure the workforce is equipped with essential competences to leverage the benefits of
recent technologies. Failure to do so may see a mismatch between new technological
capabilities and current skillsets, forecasting a potential gap in the workforce.<br><br>

Furthermore, the government must also consider the upfront investment cost that are
needed for a successful implementation, such as maintenance, upgrades, and security
patching. Comprehensive strategies must be established to ensure long-standing
sustainability and effectiveness, as well as continuous improvements and adaptations in
technologies.<br><br>

Another challenge that serves as a concern for the public is the perception of robots stealing
jobs. While technological growth may automate certain tasks, it is critical to highlight that
the role of medical and healthcare professionals cannot be entirely replaced. Rather, the
advancement should be perceived as a tool that enhances the capabilities of these
technologies, enabling attention on more complex and personalized care.<br><br>
Moreover, the aversion and skepticism towards innovative technologies also obstruct its
extensive adoption, as people require satisfactory knowledge and information to feel
comfortable in accepting this progression. Without comprehensive understanding and
transparency, there may be hesitation within the community to integrate these advancing
technologies.<br><br>
Additionally, the nervousness surrounding the impersonal nature of technology-powered
encounters may make patients apprehensive. Therefore, it is essential to not sacrifice
compassionate and empathetic interaction due to technological integration between
patients and medical and healthcare professionals.<br><br>
