<p>
The rise of robotics in medicine and healthcare accompanies many ethical issues such as privacy and data security; liability and accountability; and equity and access.<br>
Privacy and data security are critical in healthcare setting as highly confidential and sensitive data of patients are stored. In order to prevent unauthorized access, I recommend that it is vital medical governance develop highly robust data protection measures and plans for data protection<br><br>
When robots are involved in medical procedures, the question of liability and accountability arises should there be any error or adverse outcomes to the patient. To combat this, I recommend clear establishments of guidelines and regulations which provide a clear role and responsibility for robotics manufacturers, systems, and medical and healthcare operators. As well as clear mechanisms for reporting and addressing such errors. <br><br>
The execution of robotics technologies may generate inequality in access for resource-constrained areas and demoted communities. To ensure an equitable distribution and access developers and researchers should be mindful of the potential biases in data of the robotic systems and actively work to mitigate them. Ethical design practices, such as regular audits and testing for bias, can help minimize discriminatory outcomes.<br><br>
