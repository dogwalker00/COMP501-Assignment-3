Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendation<br><br>

Robotics in the medical field is a vast idea that allows the ability to enhance, save and innovatively solve solutions in medical areas. While this is an exciting idea it comes with risks and fears. Ethical issues based on Robotics can be complex and require heavy consideration. Robotic systems in healthcare like surgical robots must prioritise patient safety and comfort both to the patient and the surgical team. Transparency in communicating the capabilities and limitations are essential to informed consent and transfer trust between healthcare professionals and the patients.Medical robots often collect and process sensitive patient data which helps in safeguarding this information. This is crucial to protect patient privacy and maintain confidentiality. Developers and healthcare providers must implement robust data protection measures to ensure that they are providing necessary care to their clients without harming anyone.<br><br>
My personal reflections help me recognize the potential benefits of robotics as a helpful ally in the healthcare field, providing improved precision, efficiency and patient care. However, It is essential to approach integrity for these robots in careful consideration as we preserve human autonomy and privacy.  Supporting the workforce is a critical aspect for responsible development teams for the deployment of medical robotics. <br><br>
I personally recommend teams in all fields of medical care to understand that technology is there to help and make things easy but that it is not wise to leave these devices unattended. Consideration and ensuring these devices are always working is essential as well as using your own cognitive ideas and procedures to make sure that people are being treated appropriately. Technology can help improve the quality of care and can be the bridge between technology developers and healthcare professionals.<br><br>
